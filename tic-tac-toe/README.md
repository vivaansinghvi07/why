# Tic-Tac-Toe

This program generates a model that contains pretty much every tic-tac-toe board, and the "optimal" computer move(s) for that position. Obviously, there is no need to make it this complicated. 

## Versions

- Version 1: Recursively generates boards in a backtracking manner and decides where the best move is (if any team has two in a row, it is optimal to place the piece there, otherwise, continue). This method is not very good for accuracy.
- Version 2: TODO - check each combination, even ones that no right-minded player would play, as it would result in the most cases covered.
