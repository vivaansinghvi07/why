# Why?
A place to store my stupid ideas for code.

## Even Odd Checker

This program generates a function to check if a number is even or odd (given a certain range) in several languages. Currently supports Python, Java, JavaScript, PostgeSQL, and Bash. View [here](https://vivaansinghvi07.github.io/why/even-odd-checker/).

## Python Uglifier

Makes a Python program as ugly and convoluted as possible while conserving all original functionality. View the README [here](https://vivaansinghvi07.github.io/why/python-uglifier).

## Tic-Tac-Toe
Contains a model which stores the optimal response for all possible moves of a Tic-Tac-Toe game, assuming X goes first. See the README [here](https://vivaansinghvi07.github.io/why/tic-tac-toe).
